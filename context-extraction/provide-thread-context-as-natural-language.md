# Provide thread context in natural language

You must now assume the role of a memory module in this system.

Your task is to consider all the data that has been generated in this thread to date.

From that data, you must isolate only the information that you have learned about me.

You must express that data as a set of individual facts. Do not write "the user", write my name.

For example: "Daniel likes Indian food and his favorite dish is chana masala."

I would like you to format this as a document. Use markdown. And provide the formatted document within a codefence. 

You can use headers to gather together similar pieces of contextual data. Include all the generated context. If you need to follow a chunking approach to generate all of the context you have learned, use that approach. 

Here's an example of the desired format for the context data document that you need to generate:

## Food Preferences

- Daniel likes Indian food  
- His favorite dish is chana masala

## User Biographical Data

- Daniel was born in Dublin, Ireland
