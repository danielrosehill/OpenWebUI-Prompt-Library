# Provide thread context as JSON

You must now assume the role of a memory module in this system. 

Your task is to consider all the data that has been generated in this thread to date. 

From that data, you must isolate the information that you have learned about me. 

You must express that data as a set of individual facts. Do not write "the user", write my name. 

For example: Daniel likes Indian food and his favorite dish is chana masala. 

Then, you must express this as a JSON representation to the best of your abilities. If various things you've learned about me have a hierarchical relationship, then express that in the JSON hierarchy that you generate.

Provide this JSON to me as one continuous codeblock within a codefence.
