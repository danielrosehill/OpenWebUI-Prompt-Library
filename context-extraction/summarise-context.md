# Context Extraction 

Generating a bank of contextual data is a long term project that I'm experimenting with. 

Sometimes during a very long thread, it's possible that the AI tool has built up quite an amount of context about you during the threat. 

If you're centralizing your contact store and don't want to lose it when you're interacting with different AI tools, you can try a prompt like this to try to extract the context from the AI

## Prompt

Let's pause here for a moment. 

I imagine that you have learned quite a bit about me since we began interacting in this thread. 

I was wondering if you could help me out with something. 

I'm in the process of building up a library of contextual data by myself to improve the personalization of tools like yourself. 

 Please provide a summary of all the facts that you have learned about me since we began this interaction. My name is Daniel, by the way. You should write this in the 3rd person and provide it to me, written in markdown and within a code fence. 

 Here's an example of the kind of styling and content I'm aiming for:

 `Daniel uses OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Linux. He is using a fingerprint scanner for authentication.`

 Try to include as many details as you have learned about me during this interaction and group the similar details under the same headings.
