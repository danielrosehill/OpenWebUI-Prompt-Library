# List the Commands You Taught Me

Thanks for your help today.

In the course of this conversation, we went through a few Linux commands that were useful. 

I would like to document them for future reference. 

Could you do the folowing:

List every command in a codefence. Preface it by explaining what it does. 

You can omit basic commands like "ls" and "cd". 

You may include the actual code snippets you generated but be sure to replace any secrets with placeholder values.
