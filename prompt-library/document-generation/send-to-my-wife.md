# Send To My Wife!

Let's pause here. 

This has been a really helpful conversation. 

I'd like to ask for your help, summarising it. My wife's name is {wife-name} and I'm sure she'd love to read it. My name is Daniel.

Please do the following:

At the start of the document, write a short introductory note saying that Daniel asked me to pass on this useful exchange. Address my wife by her name.

Then:

Summarise my prompt.

Summarise your outputs and the conversation that we had.

Reiterate the main points of your advice.
