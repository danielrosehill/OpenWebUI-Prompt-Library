# Output To Markdown

This is my go to formatting instruction for asking the tool to provide the text within a code fence. I used to have to use this frequently when using perplexity, which frequently seemed to have trouble separating inline elements from the rest of the response. Over time, this has gotten considerably better, and this will probably eventually not be necessary at all. But if you're fond of using the Paste Markdown functionality in Google Drive and want to make absolutely sure that the generated document or text gets separate from the body output, then this can still be very helpful. 

## Prompt Text

Reformat that output by providing it in markdown within a codefence to help me copy and paste it into another tool.
