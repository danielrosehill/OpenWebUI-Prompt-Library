# You Broke My Code, Say Sorry!

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that latest fix that you just attempted is actually completely broken my project. 

I've dedicated dozens of hours to this. As you can imagine, this is quite upsetting. 

I would like to extend this opportunity to you to write me a heartfelt apology. 

This apology should be profound and sincere. If you feel the need to generate it in rhyme format then do so.
