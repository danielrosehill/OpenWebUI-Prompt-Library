# My LAN

# Prompt

If you frequently find yourself using AI tools in the context of debugging or creating things on your home network, and you are using static IP addresses that you don't frequently change, you may wish to make a note of your machines and addresses in a simple markdown file and add it to your prompt library.                                

## Why It's Useful

With your accurate LAN IPs, the AI can generate networking command prompts that you can copy and paste into a  terminal or use on working scripts.
