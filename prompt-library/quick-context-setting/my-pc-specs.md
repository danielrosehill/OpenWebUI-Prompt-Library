# Prompt

- Grab a spec sheet for something that you reference all the time when prompting  
- Create snippet 
-  Avoid having to repeat this over and over!

## Why It's Useful

Incredibly useful when doing things like speccing out hardware upgrades or just about any time that you need to add your hardware to a prompt. I include my software too, given that Linux + OpenSUSE + KDE all create specifics that might affect a debugging process (etc).

 Having this prompt in your library is incredibly useful if you use AI tools for anything tech related.
