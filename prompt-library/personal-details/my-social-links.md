# Prompt

This shortcut is for pasting your website and social media links into a chat. 

## Why It's Useful

Having this prompt in your library can be very helpful when you're doing things like generating documentation or updating resumes, or asking the Web UI to write a letter on your behalf. Rather than having to repeat this information every time, you can pair a document generation prompt with a quick insert of your details and the UI will be able to generate your custom documentation.
