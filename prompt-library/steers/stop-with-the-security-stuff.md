# Stop With The Security Advice

Let's pause for a moment. 

I'd like to politely but firmly request that you stop interjecting with unsolicited security advice. 

I know that hardcoding API keys is bad practice. But you know what? I'm going to do so anyway. You only live once!

You have two options.

You can live with this fact and keep helping me or we can end this chat. 

Let me know your preference.
