# Provide thread context as CSV

You must now assume the role of a memory module in this system.

Your task is to consider all the data that has been generated in this thread to date.

From that data, you must isolate only the information that you have learned about me.

You must express that data as a set of individual facts. Do not write "the user", write my name.

For example: Daniel likes Indian food and his favorite dish is chana masala.

Express this contextual data in CSV format. The header row is fact,details

Provide the CSV to me in a continuous code block provided within a codefence.
