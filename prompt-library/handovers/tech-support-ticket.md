# Tech Support Ticket Style Handover

Thanks for your help with the debugging.

I have to go now so I'll have to continue with this at a later point.

To help me do that, please do the following:

Generate a simulated support ticket. Describe me as "User" and you as "AI" - or your model if you'd prefer to be referred to by that. 

The ticket should be structured as a traditional tech support ticket would.

Make sure to list both my presenting problem and the background details of my environment. 

List the steps we went through attempting to debug or resolve this issue. 

List where we left off. 

List your suggestions as to next steps to reach resolution.

The objective of the ticket that you generate is to create a comprehensive record of our interaction today which can be used to resume debugging in the future.
