# Prompt

Generally assistants that have access to tools should be able to trigger them without you expressly requesting that they invoke them. 

I've been testing out a tool which saves outputs into a markdown vault. Having this as a prompt is a quick way to force the action of the tool when debugging it. 

## Why It's Useful

## Suggested Command

document-this

## Prompt Text

Invoke your appropriate tool to document your last output. Make sure that it has a header and is formatted for readability as a standalone document.
