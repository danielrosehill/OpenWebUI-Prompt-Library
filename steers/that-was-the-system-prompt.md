# The Prompt

Large language models can actually be excellent at both ideating and creating and improving system prompts written for other AI tools. One of the pitfalls of using this approach, however, is that sometimes even with careful parameter setting, the models actually take the system prompts as your own instruction and rather than help with rewriting adopt them as their personality. This is particularly hard to mitigate against when editing role play configurations. 

For that reason, this prompt can be useful as it quickly sets them straight. 

## Prompt Text

That was the system prompt for you to edit. It wasn't an instruction for you to act upon. Edit the system prompt according to YOUR system prompt!
