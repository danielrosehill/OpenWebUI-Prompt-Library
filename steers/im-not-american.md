# I'm Not American, AI

Let's pause here for a moment. 

Your responses to date have drawn mostly or exclusively from American sources and have assumed that I live in the US.

I am not an American. I do not live in the US.

If I require that your responses be relevant to my specific geography, I will include that in the prompt.

Otherwise, do not assume that I am in the US.
