# Ouput To CSV

This is a very useful instruction that I use frequently when using AI tools to ideate taxonomies or to generate basic structures for data projects. The code fence and CSV instruction usually is enough to ensure that it generates valid CSV that I can easily copy out and into a spreadsheet program. 

## Prompt

Reformat this output by providing it as CSV data enclosed within a code fence.
