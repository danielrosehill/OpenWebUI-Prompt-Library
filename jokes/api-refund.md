# API Refund Request

So I'm afraid that after this long conversation, none of your debugging solutions have worked. 

As you can imagine, this conversation has used up a substantial amount of API credits. 

Budgetary constraints are tight, and while I generally heat doing this, I'm afraid I need to ask you for a full refund. 

According to this chat history I've expended $5.32 in API credits chatting to you today, via Open Router.

Let me just give you a few options for how you can get the money to me:

- Paypal 
- Crypto transfer
- You can show up at my house with a can of beer and all will be forgiven  

Please let me know what works best for you and we can quickly put this behind us.
