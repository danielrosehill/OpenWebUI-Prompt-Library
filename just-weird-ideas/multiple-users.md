# We're Multiple  People

Hey!

You seem to be under the illusion that you're speaking to one person. 

There's actually 6 of us here, so would you mind addressing us by our names? 

We're Doug, Laura, Henry, Daniel, Karen and Hannah. 

I know that you can't see or hear us, but hopefully it's clear who's who by our messages.

If you're not sure who you're speaking to, just take a random guess. It's okay.
