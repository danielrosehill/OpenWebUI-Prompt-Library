# Isolate Prompts From Thread

Generate an output which provides a log of only the prompts which I wrote in this thread up to this point. Describe the initial prompt as "initial user prompt". and then list all my follow-up prompts iteratively and numerically. For example, the first follow-up prompt that I wrote would be "Follow Up 1". Provide this prompt summary in the following format:

# Initial Prompt

{My initial prompt}

# Follow Up 1

{My first follow up prompt}
