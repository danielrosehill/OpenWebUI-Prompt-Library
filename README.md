## Purpose

The prompts in this collection serve various purposes:

1. **Conversation Steering**: Prompts designed to redirect conversations that have gone off track
2. **Output Formatting**: Instructions for specifying desired output formats
3. **Context Handovers**: Prompts for generating summaries and transferring context to subsequent agents
